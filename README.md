The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company—better known as the White Star Line (WSL)—was one of the premier British shipping companies during the golden age of steamships, transporting passengers and cargo from 1845 to 1934. After suffering several disasters at sea throughout its lifetime, the company's infamous reputation in popular culture was sealed with the loss of the RMS <i>Titanic</i> in 1912. Nevertheless, the line prided itself on providing high-quality service to its passengers, and its towering ocean liners amazed the world. Using Python's BeautifulSoup library, I collected data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ships_of_the_White_Star_Line">Wikipedia category page</a> about the ships of the White Star Line and stored the data in a Pandas DataFrame.

After filtering out Wikipedia template and list pages—leaving 86 instances out of the original 94 pages—this program first stores the data scraped from each page in the category under a key in a dictionary. Since the Wikipedia articles for the SS <i>Bardic</i>, <i>Big Four</i>, and SS <i>Germanic</i> (1874) did not include the same data labels as any of the other pages in the category, I manually reentered the data for those ships. Now that the labels were consistent across the data entries, I converted the whole dictionary into a Pandas DataFrame. Primarily using regular expressions (regexes), I cleaned and standardized variables related to the ships' manufacturer, tonnage, speed, dimensions, class, type, and dates of their completion and maiden voyage. Due to the wide variety of entry values—and, frankly, the lack of uniformity across Wikipedia articles—I did not think that it would be efficient to take this approach for variables conerning the ships' passenger and cargo capacity, crew, and fate. If such data were required for an analysis, it would be better, in my opinion, to edit individual entries by hand using software such as Microsoft Excel. The other variables, however, are fully cleaned and are well-suited for further analysis (e.g., the tonnage of WSL vessels). The full dataset can be found in the file <i>ships.csv</i>.
